<h1> Lab 2 </h1>
The deadline for submitting the lab is <b>Friday, Nov 3th 14.00pm CET</b>.  

## Warnings!

The deadline for submitting the lab is **Friday, Nov 3rd 2:00PM CET**. Until then you can modify your files as much as you'd like, we will only consider your final pushes. For all the questions you may have, please use the **Issues** page in the **home** repository.



- **Make sure your code compiles**. Test it yourself before submitting! You will receive 0 points for any file that does not compile.
- **Make sure you do NOT use any methods, classes etc. that we did not cover in the lecture!** It is important that you learn the basics. If you are not 100% sure whether you are allowed to use a certain approach, post a question in the Issues page.
- **Make sure your output looks exactly the same as what is expected in the exercise.**
- **Your class name and your file name are supposed to be the same.** (Example: class name: Stairs ; file name: Stairs.java). Use the class name we give you in the assignment.
- **Don't use non-ASCII characters in your code**, otherwise the compiler might fail.
- **Don't forget to write meaningful comments** (this part is really helpful for us to better understand your thread of thought, so if things go wrong we could give partial points)
- **Make sure your code is indented properly** and be consistent with the formatting (most convenient way for Visual Studio Code: Shift+Alt+F)
- **Begin all your java files with the honour code.**
  
Honour Code:
<pre>
/**
 * Course:      Data Structures and Algorithms for Computational Linguistics I WS23/24
 * Assignment:  (lab, exercise)
 * Author:      (Your Name)
 * Description: (What does the program do?)
 *
 * Honor Code:  I pledge that this program represents my own work.
 *  I received help from:
 *   (enter the names of others that helped with the assignment, or
 *   no one if you received no help)
 *  in designing and debugging my program.
 */
 </pre>

<h2> Exercise 1 </h2>
Clone this repository to your computer. From there, open the file <tt>LoveHate.java</tt> to complete this task.  
  
Unfortunately the Java Code Eater Virus has removed most of the code from the program. Please, reconstruct it with the help of the comments of the program (which fortunately have been spared by the virus).

**(3 points)**  

<h2> Exercise 2 </h2>

Create a program <tt>Words.java</tt> which reads three words and prints the input as following:

- The first word in capital letters
- The second word in lower case letters
- The first two characters of the third word (we assume that the third word is always at least two characters long)

**Example output:**
<pre>
Enter three words: Hello lovely world

Word one as upper case: HELLO
Second word as lower case: lovely
First two characters of word three: wo
</pre>

**(4 points)**
