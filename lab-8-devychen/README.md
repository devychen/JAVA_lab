#  Lab8 - Arrays

<b> Main contents: Chapter7, Savitch </b>

The deadline for submitting the lab is <b>Friday, Dec 15th 14.00 CET</b>.

<h2>Exercise 1</h2>

<p>
This week you should practice to write a class based on a documentation.<br>

Create a class <tt><strong>ArrayUtils</strong></tt> that implements several helper methods for arrays.
</p>
<p>
Please implement all the methods in the documentation (you can find the documentation under <code>/doc/ArrayUtils.html</code>). Once you've cloned the repository to your local machine, open the <tt><strong>ArrayUtils.html</strong></tt> with a browser of your preference, for visualization. (Opening the file directly through GitHub will only give you the raw file). You can just ignore the other files in the doc-directory. Please read the <b>whole</b> documentation before you start making your program sketch. It is important that you use the correct method names and the correct parameters to every method.<br>

In addition, please make sure that you validate the method arguments before working with them. In other words: <b>Each of your methods should be able to deal with null-arguments!</b>
</p>
<b>(7 points)</b>

<h2>Exercise 2</h2>

<p>
In addition to implementing the required methods, you should also write JUnit test cases. You should test each method under different aspects. To get you going, you can use the starter code provided in the <tt><strong>ArrayUtilsTest</strong></tt> test class</a>.<br>
</p>
<b>(3 points)</b>
<br><br>

<p>Needless to say: You must provide javadoc comments as well as comments describing the program flow.</p>
